As youngsters increasingly turn to technology for work & play, society's elderly are often left behind in this digital trend, becoming more & more isolated. With Maestro, we aim to bring together members of society of different ages through the ancient art of TaiChi, breaking barriers in communication whilst promoting good physical and mental health. Maestro is designed with the objective of enhancing social inclusion and inter-generational understanding, by tackling 2 severe issues in our community: elderly depression & the lack of inter-generational interaction. By leveraging state-of-the-art Artificial Intelligence technology, we create a virtual AI TaiChi tutor app via the PoseNet model for Human-Pose-Estimation. Through the gamification & modernisation of TaiChi, generations can revel in the joy of practicising TaiChi, while simultaneously promoting inter-generational interaction & adhesion.
